Procedure:

- Simulate data using JMBayes code: 
- Call simulated data in python:
- Separate the simulated data into test and training set
- Run the example2.py file line by line to ensure yhat_long and yhat_surv do not produce NAs when inspecting loss
- Fit the Transformer using the training data
- Save the Predicted survival probabilities as a csv files
- Call output predicted probabilities into R
- Run the tdroc function on the predicted probabilities
